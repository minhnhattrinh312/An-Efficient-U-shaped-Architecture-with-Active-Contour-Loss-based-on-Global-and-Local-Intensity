# GLAC-Unet: Global-Local Active Contour Loss with an Efficient U-Shaped Architecture for Multiclass Medical Image Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of the paper [GLAC-Unet: Global-Local Active Contour Loss with an Efficient U-Shaped Architecture for Multiclass Medical Image Segmentation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-025-01387-9).

## Overview

GLAC-Unet introduces a novel loss function that combines global and local intensity information for improved segmentation performance in medical images. The architecture is based on a U-Net structure, which is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in image segmentation tasks.

## Features

- **Global-Local Active Contour Loss**: Combines global and local intensity information.
- **U-Shaped Architecture**: Efficient and effective for segmentation tasks.
- **Multiclass Segmentation**: Capable of segmenting multiple classes in medical images.
